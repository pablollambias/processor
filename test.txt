#Immediate Arithmetic Operation.

#ADDIU

ADDIU $0, $1, 5  #0, bc 0 register should stay 0

ADDIU $1, $1, 6  #6

ADDIU $2, $2, 1  #1

ADDIU $3, $3, 2  #2

ADDIU $4, $4, 3  #3

ADDIU $5, $0, 2  #2

ADDIU $6, $6, 1000 #1000

ADDIU $10, $0, 32767 #32767, max int to a zero

ADDIU $7, $1, 10 #16 6+10=16

ADDIU $2, $2, 0 #1

ADDIU $11, $5, 32767 #? adding a max int to a nonzero value

ADDIU $12, $0, -20 #? adding negative to zero

ADDIU $13, $5, -32767 #-32765 adding a min int to a nonzero value

#ADDIU with hazards
ADDIU $3, $7, 2  #18 from execute

ADDIU $1, $7, 2  #18 from memory

#ANDI

ANDI $8, $0, 0 #0, 0 AND 0, testing zero

ANDI $9, $4, 3 #3, 3 AND 3, testing same number

ANDI $10, $6, 1243 #200 , testing a random number(dif numbers)

#ANDI with hazards

ANDI $14, $9, 3 # 3, from execute

ANDI $15, $9, 2 # 2, from memory
