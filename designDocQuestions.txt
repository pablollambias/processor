Questions for Alonzo:

1. is extension left or right
2. for sign extension is it all #s or just most seg bit
3. is low order the lease seg bits of RS



Bits 26-31 (opcode) in instruction (deciding between I/J R types and LW/SW)
    if all 0's then we have a R-type.
    if bit 31=1 then LW/SW (ignore for this project)- make sure register values dont change)

-if not then we have an I/J type.
    if bit 29=1 then I-Type
    if not J OR Branch(Ignore for this project)- make sure register values dont change)

* for R and I type we drew up a sketch of how to input into the ALU.

What OpCode to input into the ALU
    for R-Type
        Question: 4. SLT, SLTU- how to compare 2 values rather than to 0 like in our gt, le ALU.
                  5. SAR- how to change opcode to fit ALU
                  6. control logic for SLLV, SRLV, and SRAV
        ADDU, SUBU, AND, OR, XOR, NOR, SLL, SRL
            shift left by one and take 4 least seg bits into ALU OpCode
        SLLV, SRLV
            look at 5 least seg bits from the value in the register that rs maps to and input that into shift amount.

    for I-Type
        ADDU, ADDI
            shift right by 2 and take 4 least seg bits into ALU OpCode
        ORI, XORI
            shift left by one and take 4 least seg bits into ALU OpCode
        Q. SLTI, SLTIU- how to compare to value and not 0
        LUI
            dont go into ALU



*rs is related to A in the ALU
*rt is realated to B in the ALU
*deal with hazards
*big picture to small- break it down not too much.
*add big idea about how we are going to test.
* we can load up code into the ROM for testing.
